# Password Generator Project

A simple application to produce a password based on selections made by the user using characters such as upper and lower case alpha, numbers, and symbols.

## How it works

After clicking "Generate Password" user is asked how many characters they'd like to use between 8 & 128. If user puts in anything other the correct parameter they'll be asked to try again. Likewise, if they don't select at least one character type to choose for their password they'll be sent back to the beginning of the character selection.
